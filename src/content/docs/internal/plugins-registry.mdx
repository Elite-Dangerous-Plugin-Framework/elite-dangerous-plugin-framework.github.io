One of EDPF's core goals is to make publishing and installing plugins as easy and intuitive as possible.

For this, we make the following assumption:
- Developers know how to use Git and can follow instructions on setting up a Github / Gitlab CI Pipeline to build releases
- Users shouldn't be expected to leave the application to go looking for plugins. Users shouldn't have to care about Git, Github/Gitlab and Releases.

## The Goal

A plugin registry acts as a way to make plugins discoverable. It lets EDPF simply fetch a JSON containing all known plugins and their metadata, making it easy to search for Plugins from within EDPF. 
Said JSON may also contain version data for a Plugin, making it easy to have EDPF replace an outdated plugin's version with a new one.

The idea would be to have plugin developers register their plugins via a PR within the registry. 
This registration consists of a JSON that is placed in the registry repository. It contains some metadata about the Plugin like 
- Plugin ID
- Repository
- Potentially the Developer's Public Key for Signed Releases

A Github Action then runs periodically, fetching all plugins
