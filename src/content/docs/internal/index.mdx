This section looks at the internals of EDPF, and how things work under the hood.

To start off, EDPF uses [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). This implies a Backend written in Rust, with a Frontend written with a Frontend technology.
All Web Views defined by EDPF use React.

![A high-level overview of EDPF's architecture](./edpf-highlevel-overview.drawio.svg)

This overview might be a bit too simplified, and expressing it like this doesn't do it justice. Let's split up the overview into two — the `Journal` path, and the `Plugin Loading and Asset Handling` path.


## Journal

EDPF uses rster2002's wonderful [`ed-journals`](https://github.com/rster2002/ed-journals) crate to handle listening and emitting journal / status file changes.
These updates are then emitted using Tauri's IPC capabilities. A plugin's context is subscribed to the relevant event.

`ed-journals` provides features to listen towards changes on the entire Journal directory, to iterate over just one file, and to listen for just one file, among other things. 
It allows you to parse each Log Item into a Rust Struct, but we don't use it because the conversion from `JSON` → `ed-journals` → `JSON` results in changes. 
In addition to that, reliance on the Structs means we require an EDPF update to handle newer files. Realisitically, Plugins would expect Journal items to not have been altered, 
which is why we rely on the `Raw` family of listeners and iterators provided by `ed_journals`.

:::caution[Partial Implementation]
Please be aware that as of 2025-12-13, there are no listeners for the non-journal files like `Status.json` or `Outfitting.json` being created.
