:::caution[Not implemented, yet]

The plugin registry is a planned feature that will be introduced to EDPF in Version 0.2.

You can see it on the Roadmap [here](/users/what-is-edpf#v02-the-plugin-registry-update).

Once implemented, you will find a list of all Plugins in the Registry on this page. For the technical users, you might be [interested in the Plugin Registry Draft](/internal/plugins-registry).
